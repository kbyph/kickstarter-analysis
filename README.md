The data here shows that the both the successful and unsuccessful kickstarters here present a left skewed graph, both with low lower quartile and high higher quartile values.

*Based on my findings, my recommendation for you Louise is to not to ask for too much money because that is the leading factor in unsuccessful kickstarters. Keep the asking prices at a reasonable cost and then build the campaign from the ground-up. In regards to the theater market, you should keep your play production costs for less than Â£4,000.
