# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
- This kickstarter analysis requires the creation two new analyses for Louise  to help
determine the different outcomes based on goals and launch dates in order for 
her to succeed in her own kickstarter campaign. The "theater outcomes by launch date" 
analysis was used to determine which kickstarter theater plays included in the 
sample dataset were either successful or failed determined in different months 
throughout a year. Similarly, the "outcomes based on goals" analysis focused on 
theater plays, but emphasized its focus on each project's target goals. With 
these two analyses, we can then determine which month is most likely for success 
and how high Louise should realistically aim for her target goal.

### Purpose
- The purpose of this analysis is to give Louise extra insight on what factors 
may cause the success or failure in a kickstarter campaign. This is because 
certain kickstarters seemingly achieve success in specific months more than others, 
or that some reuest for too little or too much funding. Therefore, we can utilize 
this information in order for Louise to determine which scenarios are a best fit 
when analyzing both factors in the sample dataset.


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- To begin the analysis, we must extract the data from the "date created 
conversion" column in order to create a new "years" column. Then we have to make 
sure that the pivot table was sorted correctly to exclude any irrelevant data by 
filtering so that the line chart matches the example given. Therefore we can 
observe the different launch dates in regards to their months to see which 
theater plays were successful, failed, canceled, and the grand total. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- For the "outcomes based on goals" sheet, we create a goal column with each 
respective dollar-amount range and then pull the data from the kickstarter sheet, 
making sure we filter out each column to only display the successful, failed, 
canceled, and total projects with their percentage rates. Lastly, we filter out 
the line chart so that only relevant information is projected correctly. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- The only challenge I initially struggled with at first was with writing down the 
correct code with the proper filters for the outcomes based on goals. However, 
with trial and error, I was able to figure it out pretty smoothly once the formula 
displayed the correct information and the rest was making sure each goal range matched.
When it came to the charts and tables, most of it was me playing around with the 
filters until the chart made sense for me and was easily readable. My recommendation 
for everyone is to utilize our resources, hints, and Google because we are all on 
the same boat herea and that is to succeed and accelerate our careers.



## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	- The first conclusion I can draw about this analysis is that successful 
theater plays thrive in the Spring season, especially in the month of May. However, 
they seem to decline especially in the Fall and Winter months possibly due to low 
demand or personal preference.
	- The second conclusion I can also draw out is that failed theater plays 
were consistent througout the year, as there were no high or low dips for any 
particular month. The same can be said about the cancelled shows, as they remained 
relatively low.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	- According to the line chart created, I can conclude that most successful 
kickstarters set their goals very low within the $1000-$10000 range, although some 
were very fortunate within the $35000-$45000 range. Therefore, lower goals seek 
a much more success rate, whereas higher goals seek more failure.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	- As for limitations, maybe some extra explaination as to what contributed 
to the success and failures of each kickstarter, or more specific data in regards 
to which city/state that each project originated from and their local feedback. That 
way we have more information to determine why some kickstarters with insanely high goals
were able to succeed and why some with very low still faced struggles.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	- Some possible tables/graphs we can create would include regional wealth 
status, supply and demand, public interests/feedback, or their average donations. 
With this information, we can determine the general public's interests and reasonings
to why they should support and what they can change.
